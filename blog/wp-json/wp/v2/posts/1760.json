Is poor coordination between developers and IT operations killing the productivity of your team? Well, we have some exciting news on that! AbyM Technologies, a Delhi-based leading Digital Marketing firm dealing in software development, app development, website development, and more brings to you this perfect answer: DevOps!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is DevOp?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DevOps is an innovative methodology stating collaboration between the software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. It brings together two traditionally separated departments, dramatically improving the efficiency of the software development lifecycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core principles on which DevOps is based include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Automation Process: <\/strong>Basically, the focus of DevOps is on automating as many tasks as possible, like testing, building, and deployment, thereby bringing down errors and creating efficiency.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Continuous Integration: <\/strong>Developers are integrating their changes automatically within a central repository at all times. This will help in the early detection and fixing of problems.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Continuous Delivery\/Continuous Deployment: <\/strong>Code changes pass through an automated testing and deployment pipeline for faster updates and releases.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Collaboration: <\/strong>DevOps encourages communication and collaboration between Dev and Ops teams toward a common goal.
