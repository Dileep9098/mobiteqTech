Let\u2019s start with few questions about your requirements &amp; priorities:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>How soon you need the APP?<\/li>\r\n<li>Do you have any in-house developed module of APP?<\/li>\r\n<li>What is your budget?<\/li>\r\n<li>What features you need?<\/li>\r\n<li>How much the speed of APP matter to you?<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>With the answer to these questions, now, let\u2019s discuss the differences between the Hybrid APPs Vs Native APPs:<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>What is Native Application?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Native APPs are developed on a particular environment or platform using software development tools (SDK) for a particular framework or operating system. Like Android APPs are built on Java platform using Java Development Kit, iOS APPs are built using iOS SDK, Swift &amp; Objective-C, and windows APPs are built using the .NET platform.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thus, Native Applications are native to the user\u2019s OS and are built as per those guidelines. They are consistent in look &amp; feel and have good interaction. User is more likely to navigate and use the APP faster.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Advantages of Native APPs:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Native code performs faster than HTML &amp; JavaScript, hence, Graphical Applications, HD Games, Intensive Applications perform well in Native.<\/li>\r\n<li>Native Applications do not have many dependencies on open source libraries and platforms like Cordova &amp; Ionic.<\/li>\r\n<li>The native APP allows accessing device features (such as camera, GPS, Address book, etc.) without dealing with the complexity of native plugins.<\/li>\r\n<li>These APPs have a high degree of Reliability and are best to exploit Native features.<\/li>\r\n<li>They are simple yet fast in Performance and have a better User Experience.<\/li>\r\n<li>Native APPs support both Online &amp; Offline transactions.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><strong>Disadvantages of Native APPs:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The development time of Native APPs is more than Hybrid APPs. As for each platform, Native APPs require separate development efforts and different skill sets.<\/li>\r\n<li>The code of each platform has its own release cycles &amp; updates which adds up to more development time and cost.<\/li>\r\n<li>Due to the different code-base, it is always challenging to release the same features on all platforms.<\/li>\r\n<li>For updates in APP, the user needs to update the APP from the APP Store.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><strong>What is a Hybrid APP?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Hybrid APP runs in a Web view and is built using Web Technologies like HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. They can be built for any platform using a single code base and have performance closer to Native APPs. We can consider them as Websites packed in a Native wrapper with most of the information loading on the page as the user navigates through the APP.<\/p>\r\n<p>These APPs require Native plugins to access the Native features of the platform such as Camera, Mic, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Advantages of Hybrid APP <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Write code once &amp; run on any platform, which means, they are single code-based for all platforms.<\/li>\r\n<li>Effort only from one Development team is required, they can deliver APP for any platform including the Website too.<\/li>\r\n<li>Since Hybrid APPs are based on Web Technologies, hence, the same APP can be run on a browser like a website or can be run as Progressive Web APP (PWA).<\/li>\r\n<li>The user experience of Hybrid APPs is consistent across all the platforms irrespective of the devices &amp; browsers.<\/li>\r\n<li>The APP development is faster and less expensive. Low-cost maintenance is required.<\/li>\r\n<li>Simple &amp; easy to maintain and is integrated with the device file system.<\/li>\r\n<li>In case of updates, the user doesn\u2019t need to update the APP in APP Store, it is directly loaded on the page from the server.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><strong>Disadvantages of Hybrid APPs<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The performance of Hybrid APPs doesn\u2019t go well for Game APPs, high Graphics-oriented APPs, and other high-performance required APPs.<\/li>\r\n<li>They are dependent on Native plugins to access device features. Sometimes, native plugins are not readily available for entirely new device features. In such cases, Hybrid APPs are the problem.<\/li>\r\n<li>Hybrid APPs have dependencies on different libraries &amp; frameworks such as Cordova &amp; Ionic. They are to be synchronized with the latest versions and releases of platforms.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><strong>So, the conclusion is:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Both Native &amp; Hybrid APPs have their pros and cons. But frankly speaking, Native APPs are always beneficial in long run. They provide high-level security for <a href=\"https:\/\/abym.in\/blog\/how-much-does-mobile-app-development-cost-in-india\/\">Mobile Applications<\/a>. With Native APPs, the company can offer an industry-standard user experience and best performance to their users.<\/p>\r\n<p>But when it comes to less development time, cross-compatibility, easy updates, and availability of resources on a low budget, then, Hybrid APPs are a good choice.<\/p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the decision on which approach you should take for <a href=\"https:\/\/abym.in\/blog\/how-much-does-mobile-app-development-cost-in-india\/\">APP development<\/a>, depends on the need, priorities, and objectives of your business.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-131\" src=\"https:\/\/abym.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ab-post.jpg\" alt=\"Hybrid APPs Vs Native APPs\" \/><\/figure><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you confused between Hybrid Mobile APP or Native Mobile APP and wondering which route you should take for your next mobile APP?
